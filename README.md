# React Tic Tac Toe

I followed along with the '[Tutorial: Intro To React](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html#getting-started)' to get a better understanding of react

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and I have created this from following the CodePen examples provided in the tutorial.

For anyone else trying out the tutorial if you make it to **[Storing a History](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html#storing-a-history)** and find it gets a bit confusing read on.

Jeffrey Wan [@Jwan622](https://github.com/Jwan622) was kind enough to submit a PR wil clearer instructions but [at the time of posting this] it's still waiting to be merged.

I have linked the PR [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8795) please go give it a :+1: if you run into the same issues and his version from his repo [here](https://github.com/Jwan622/react/blob/patch-5/docs/tutorial/tutorial.md)

Also just for belt and braces I have taken a copy of the instruction and added to this repo [here](./tutorial.md)
